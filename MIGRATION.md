# Migration to Simplified Architecture

## What Changed

### Before (Complex)
```
MariaDB → Debezium Server → NATS JetStream → (Future Spring Boot) → Business Logic
```

### After (Simple)
```
MariaDB → Spring Boot (Embedded Debezium) → Business Logic
```

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Fewer moving parts, easier to understand and maintain
2. **Faster Development**: Direct access to CDC events in your application code
3. **Lower Resource Usage**: No need for NATS or standalone Debezium server
4. **Easier Debugging**: All logic in one application with straightforward logging
5. **Better for Small-Medium Scale**: Perfect for projects that don't need distributed messaging

## What Was Removed

- NATS JetStream message broker
- Debezium Server (standalone)
- NATS configuration files
- Network complexity

## What Was Added

- `hr-cdc-service/` - Spring Boot application with embedded Debezium
  - Main application class
  - Debezium configuration
  - CDC event handlers
  - Health check endpoints

## Migration Steps

If you had the old setup running:

```bash
# Stop old services
docker-compose down -v

# Start new services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Watch CDC events
docker-compose logs -f hr-cdc-service

# Test the pipeline
./scripts/test-cdc.sh
```

## When NOT to Use This Simplified Approach

Consider the previous NATS-based architecture if you need:

1. **Multiple Consumers**: Different services need to process the same CDC events
2. **Message Replay**: Ability to replay events from history
3. **Event Persistence**: Long-term event storage with guaranteed delivery
4. **Distributed Systems**: Multiple instances consuming events in parallel
5. **Decoupling**: Complete separation between CDC capture and processing

For those use cases, you can:
- Use Kafka instead of NATS (more mature ecosystem)
- Keep embedded Debezium but publish to Kafka
- Add NATS back if needed for specific use cases

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything
make start

# Run tests
make test

# View CDC logs
make logs-cdc

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Code Structure

```
hr-cdc-service/
├── src/main/java/com/hr/cdc/
│   ├── HrCdcApplication.java         # Main app
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── DebeziumConfig.java       # Debezium setup
│   ├── handler/
│   │   └── CdcEventHandler.java      # Event processing
│   └── controller/
│       └── HealthController.java     # Health checks
└── src/main/resources/
    └── application.properties         # Configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement business logic in `CdcEventHandler.java`
2. Add event publishers (if needed) to external systems
3. Add monitoring and metrics
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Deploy to your environment
